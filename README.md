The Centralized Content Management (CCM) plugin streamlines content management across WordPress multisite networks. This powerful tool enables you to create, update, and synchronize content from a central site to selected subsites, ensuring consistency and efficiency. Whether managing posts, pages, taxonomies, or media, CCM simplifies multisite content distribution with selective syncing and automated updates.

* **Media & Taxonomy Handling**: Syncs media files and taxonomy terms between the central and selected subsites.
* **Permissions Control**: Allows content modification restrictions on subsites based on central site settings.
* **Relational Fields Support**: Maintains post relationships and associations across central and subsite content.
* **Deletion Settings**: Automatically remove content from subsites when deleted from the central site.
